/**
 * Declares the complete RabbitMQ broker infrastructure required by the arInfra event system.
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class is responsible for one thing: telling RabbitMQ what queues, exchanges, and bindings
 * must exist before the application starts processing events. All declarations are
 * <b>idempotent</b> — if the infrastructure already exists on the broker with the same
 * configuration, RabbitMQ will leave it untouched. If it does not exist, RabbitMQ will create it
 * automatically when the application context starts.
 *
 * <p>You do not need to interact with this class directly. It is wired automatically by the arInfra
 * framework. Its only dependency is your {@code application.yml} configuration.
 *
 * <h2>Infrastructure declared</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class declares two parallel sets of infrastructure: the <b>main</b> pipeline that
 * processes live events, and the <b>Dead Letter</b> pipeline that receives events that have
 * exhausted all retry attempts.
 *
 * <h3>Main pipeline</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Main queue</b> ({@code spring.rabbitmq.queue}): durable queue where published events
 *       land and wait for consumption. Durable means messages survive a RabbitMQ broker restart.
 *   <li><b>Main exchange</b> ({@code spring.rabbitmq.exchange}): a direct exchange that routes
 *       incoming messages to the main queue using an exact routing key match.
 *   <li><b>Main binding</b>: connects the main queue to the main exchange via {@code
 *       spring.rabbitmq.routing-key}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Dead Letter (DLQ) pipeline</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>DLX exchange</b> ({@code <exchange>.dlx}): receives messages that the retry interceptor
 *       has given up on, after exhausting all configured retry attempts.
 *   <li><b>DLQ queue</b> ({@code <queue>.dlq}): durable queue where dead messages accumulate for
 *       manual inspection or offline reprocessing.
 *   <li><b>DLQ binding</b>: connects the DLQ queue to the DLX exchange via {@code
 *       <routing-key>.dead}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The DLQ names are always derived from the main names — no additional properties are needed:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Main queue:    my-app.events     →  DLQ:  my-app.events.dlq
 *   Main exchange: my-app.exchange   →  DLX:  my-app.exchange.dlx
 *   Routing key:   my-app.routing    →  Dead: my-app.routing.dead
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>How the Dead Letter flow works</h2>
 *
 * <p>The main queue is declared with two RabbitMQ arguments ({@code x-dead-letter-exchange} and
 * {@code x-dead-letter-routing-key}) that instruct the broker where to forward a message when it is
 * rejected without requeue. This rejection happens after all retry attempts configured in {@link
 * EventConf} are exhausted.
 *
 * <p>The full failure path is:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Event published
 *     → Main exchange
 *       → Main queue
 *         → Consumer fails
 *           → Retry interceptor retries N times with exponential backoff
 *             → All retries exhausted
 *               → RepublishMessageRecoverer forwards to DLX
 *                 → DLQ queue (message stored for inspection)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Dead messages in the DLQ are <b>never automatically reprocessed</b>. They can be inspected via
 * the RabbitMQ management UI, re-queued manually after fixing the underlying issue, or consumed by
 * a separate monitoring or alerting service.
 *
 * <h2>Required application properties</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * spring:
 *   rabbitmq:
 *     queue:       my-app.events
 *     exchange:    my-app.exchange
 *     routing-key: my-app.routing
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see EventConf for retry interceptor, backoff configuration, and listener container setup
 * @see EventConsumer for the message listener
 * @see EventProducer for the message publisher
