/**
 * Configures the RabbitMQ connection, message template, retry behaviour, and listener container for
 * the arInfra event system.
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class is the central configuration hub for the arInfra messaging infrastructure. It sets
 * up everything the application needs to <b>reliably send and consume</b> events over RabbitMQ: the
 * connection to the broker, the template used to publish messages, the retry interceptor that
 * automatically retries failed events with exponential backoff, and the listener container factory
 * that controls how {@link EventConsumer} receives messages.
 *
 * <p>You do not need to interact with this class directly. It is wired automatically by the arInfra
 * framework. Behaviour is controlled entirely through your {@code application.yml}.
 *
 * <h2>How retry works</h2>
 *
 * <p>When a consumer throws an exception while processing an event, the arInfra framework does
 * <b>not</b> silently drop the message. Instead, it follows this sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The <b>retry interceptor</b> catches the exception and records the failure against the
 *       message's unique identity (stateful retry).
 *   <li>The message is <b>NACKed without requeue</b>, so it goes back to the main queue via
 *       RabbitMQ's internal redelivery mechanism.
 *   <li>The interceptor <b>waits</b> for the configured backoff duration before allowing redelivery
 *       (exponential: 1 s → 2 s → 4 s → 8 s, capped at 30 s by default).
 *   <li>Steps 1–3 repeat until either processing succeeds or {@code max-attempts} is reached.
 *   <li>On final failure, the <b>RepublishMessageRecoverer</b> forwards the message to the Dead
 *       Letter Exchange (DLX), from where it lands in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual
 *       inspection. The message is enriched with failure headers at that point ({@code
 *       x-exception-message}, {@code x-exception-stacktrace}, etc.).
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Why stateful retry?</b> Stateful retry tracks failure state per message identity rather
 * than retrying in-memory within a single thread. This means if the application restarts mid-retry,
 * the retry count is not lost — the message is redelivered by RabbitMQ and the retry count resumes
 * correctly. This is critical for resilience in production environments.
 *
 * <h2>How acknowledgement works</h2>
 *
 * <p>The listener container is configured with <b>manual acknowledgement</b> ({@code
 * AcknowledgeMode.MANUAL}). This means:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A message is ACKed ({@code basicAck}) only after {@code accept()} completes successfully in
 *       {@link EventConsumer}.
 *   <li>If an exception propagates out of the listener method, the retry interceptor takes over —
 *       it handles NACKing internally. The consumer itself does not NACK on failure.
 *   <li>This guarantees <b>at-least-once delivery</b>: a message is never lost due to an
 *       application crash or processing failure.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Retry configuration (application.yml)</h2>
 *
 * <p>All retry parameters are externalized and can be tuned per environment without code changes:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * app:
 *   rabbitmq:
 *     ssl: false                       # enable SSL/TLS (default: false)
 *     retry:
 *       max-attempts:     5            # total attempts before DLQ (default: 5)
 *       initial-delay-ms: 1000         # wait before first retry in ms (default: 1000)
 *       multiplier:       2.0          # backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
 *       max-delay-ms:     30000        # maximum backoff cap in ms (default: 30000)
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>With the defaults above, the retry schedule for a failing event is:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Attempt 1: immediate
 *   Attempt 2: wait  1 000 ms
 *   Attempt 3: wait  2 000 ms
 *   Attempt 4: wait  4 000 ms
 *   Attempt 5: wait  8 000 ms → failure → DLQ
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Connection configuration (application.yml)</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * spring:
 *   rabbitmq:
 *     host:     localhost
 *     port:     5672
 *     username: guest
 *     password: guest
 *     vhost:    /                      # optional, defaults to "/"
 *     exchange: my-app.exchange
 *     routing-key: my-app.routing
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see RabbitConfig for queue, exchange, and DLQ broker declarations
 * @see EventConsumer for the message listener implementation
 * @see InfraEvent for the base event contract
