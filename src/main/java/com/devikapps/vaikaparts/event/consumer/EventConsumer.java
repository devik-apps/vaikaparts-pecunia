/**
 * Listens to the main RabbitMQ queue, deserializes incoming messages into {@link InfraEvent}
 * instances, and dispatches them to their corresponding handler services.
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class is the entry point for all event consumption in the arInfra framework. It sits
 * between the RabbitMQ broker and your application logic, handling the low-level concerns of
 * message reception, deserialization, acknowledgement, and error propagation — so that your event
 * handler services can focus purely on business logic.
 *
 * <p>You do not need to interact with this class directly. To handle an event, create a Spring
 * service that implements {@code Consumer<InfraEvent>} and name it after the event class (see
 * <b>How to handle an event</b> below). The framework will route the event to your service
 * automatically.
 *
 * <h2>How a message flows through this class</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>RabbitMQ delivers a raw JSON string to {@link #onMessage(String, Channel, long)}.
 *   <li>The message is deserialized from JSON into the concrete {@link InfraEvent} subtype using
 *       the shared {@link ObjectMapper}, which has been pre-configured by {@link
 *       InfraEventTypeRegistrar} with an explicit allowlist of all known event types.
 *   <li>The deserialized event's {@code attemptNb} counter is incremented to reflect the current
 *       attempt number, which is useful for logging and conditional logic in handlers.
 *   <li>The event is passed to {@link EventDispatcher}, which resolves the correct handler service
 *       by convention (see {@link EventDispatcher} for the naming rules) and invokes it.
 *   <li>If processing completes without exception, the message is <b>ACKed</b> ({@code basicAck}) —
 *       RabbitMQ removes it from the queue permanently.
 *   <li>If processing throws an exception, it propagates out of {@link #onMessage} to the <b>retry
 *       interceptor</b> configured in {@link EventConf}, which handles redelivery and eventual
 *       routing to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Acknowledgement and retry interaction</h2>
 *
 * <p>The listener container is configured with <b>manual acknowledgement</b>. This means:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>On <b>success</b>: this class calls {@code channel.basicAck()} explicitly after {@link
 *       #accept(String)} returns normally.
 *   <li>On <b>failure</b>: this class does <b>not</b> call {@code basicNack()}. The exception
 *       propagates to the retry interceptor (an AOP advice wrapping this listener), which owns the
 *       NACK and redelivery scheduling. This avoids double-signalling the same delivery tag, which
 *       would corrupt the AMQP channel.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The full retry-to-DLQ path is managed by the infrastructure configured in {@link EventConf}.
 * Handler services do not need to implement any retry logic — throwing an unchecked exception is
 * sufficient to trigger the full pipeline.
 *
 * <h2>Deserialization and security</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class uses the application-wide {@link ObjectMapper} bean, which is configured by {@link
 * InfraEventTypeRegistrar} to use an explicit allowlist of named subtypes (via {@code
 * JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME}). This prevents arbitrary class instantiation from crafted JSON payloads
 * (CWE-502 / OWASP Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
 *
 * <p>If deserialization fails (malformed JSON, unknown type, etc.), the message is logged at ERROR
 * level and {@link #accept(String)} returns normally — triggering an ACK. This is intentional: a
 * malformed message will never succeed no matter how many times it is retried, so retrying it would
 * only fill the DLQ with noise. The message is effectively discarded, and the error log is the
 * signal to investigate.
 *
 * <h2>How to handle an event</h2>
 *
 * <p>Create a Spring {@code @Service} that implements {@code Consumer<InfraEvent>} and name it
 * after the event class in camelCase with the suffix {@code Service}. The framework will route the
 * event to your service automatically — no registration or wiring is needed.
 *
 * <p>Example: to handle {@code PaymentRequested} events:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Service("paymentRequestedService")
 * public class PaymentRequestedService implements Consumer<PaymentRequested> {
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public void accept(PaymentRequested paymentRequested) {
 *     // your business logic here
 *     // throw any RuntimeException to trigger retry → DLQ
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see EventDispatcher for the convention-based event-to-handler routing mechanism
 * @see EventConf for retry, backoff, and acknowledgement configuration
 * @see RabbitConfig for the queue and DLQ broker declarations
 * @see InfraEvent for the base event contract

   * <p>This method is the core processing pipeline for a single message:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Deserializes the JSON string into the concrete {@link InfraEvent} subtype.
   *   <li>If deserialization fails, logs the error and returns normally (no retry — see below).
   *   <li>Increments the event's {@code attemptNb} counter for observability in handler logs.
