 * Test event for verifying messaging infrastructure functionality.

 * <p>The event includes a configurable wait duration that simulates processing time, allowing
 * health checks to verify that timeout and retry mechanisms are functioning as expected.

 * <p><b>Associated handler:</b> This event should be handled by a service bean named {@code
 * dummyEventService} that implements {@code Consumer<InfraEvent>}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link JsonIgnoreProperties} annotation allows backward compatibility if additional fields
 * are added to serialized events in the queue.
