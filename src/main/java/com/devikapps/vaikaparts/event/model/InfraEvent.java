/**
 * Abstract base class for all infrastructure events in the RabbitMQ messaging system.
 *
 * <p>All events published to RabbitMQ must extend this class and implement the required timing
 * configuration methods. This class provides visibility timeout calculation, retry handling, and
 * polymorphic deserialization support.
 *
 * <p><b>Security Note:</b> This class uses {@code JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME} instead of {@code
 * JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS} to prevent arbitrary class instantiation attacks. All concrete event types
 * must be explicitly registered using {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSubTypes}.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation requirements:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implement {@link #maxConsumerDuration()} to specify maximum processing time
 *   <li>Implement {@link #maxConsumerBackoffBetweenRetries()} to define retry delay
 *   <li>Ensure the event class is {@link Serializable} for message queue persistence
 *   <li>Register concrete event class in {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSubTypes}
 *       allowlist
 * </ul>
