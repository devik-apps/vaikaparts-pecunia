/**
 * Spring configuration for RabbitMQ queue, exchange, and binding setup.
 *
 * <p>This configuration class declares the RabbitMQ infrastructure components required for message
 * routing: a durable queue for storing messages, a direct exchange for routing, and a binding that
 * connects them with a specific routing key.
 *
 * <p><b>Required application properties:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code spring.rabbitmq.queue} - Queue name for message storage
 *   <li>{@code spring.rabbitmq.exchange} - Exchange name for message routing
 *   <li>{@code spring.rabbitmq.routing-key} - Routing key for queue binding
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Infrastructure components:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Queue:</b> Durable queue that persists messages across broker restarts
 *   <li><b>Exchange:</b> Direct exchange routes messages based on exact routing key matches
 *   <li><b>Binding:</b> Connects the queue to the exchange with the specified routing key
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These components are automatically declared on the RabbitMQ broker when the application
 * starts, ensuring the messaging infrastructure is ready for use.
